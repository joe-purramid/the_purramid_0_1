On launch, the spotlight app applies a shade overlay to the screen. The color of the shade is charcoal (or some other light black) at 50% opacity. The "spotlight" is a circle where that shade is not applied.



It can be dragged around the screen with a single finger. It can be resized with two fingers. A floating menu bar should include three icons, a "close" cross, an "add another" plus, and a "shape" square or circle.



The shape of the spotlight can be changed as part of the resizing gesture. It can be made into an oval, with the foci forming a line with the user's fingers.



Close ends the app activity.



Add another creates a second circular spotlight that can be manipulated separately from the first. There can be no more than four spotlights active at a time.



Shape changes the shape of the spotlight from circle to square. When that happens, the shape button changes from a square to a circle. This change applies to all spotlights on screen. If the user changes back to circle, the shape changes back to square.



Squares can be reshaped into rectangles in the same way circles can be reshaped into ovals.



Each icon has a tooltip, "Close Application", "Add Another Spotlight", and "Change Shape", respectively.



After app close, when it starts, it opens only one spotlight. After app destroy, it will display however many spotlights open at the time of destroy.
