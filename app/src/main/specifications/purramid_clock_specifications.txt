Clock is a collection of timekeeping services that allows teachers to demonstrate how time works across the globe. It creates a digital or analog clock to manage classroom time.

 --- RUNTIME EVENTS ---
(1) On first app-intent launch, the clock opens in a windowed state.
(2) The most recent clock user preferences are saved. Save the following:
	(2.1) Clock size
	(2.2) 24-hour toggle state
	(2.3) Current time zone
	(2.4) Seconds togle state
	(2.5) All user-created alarms
		(2.5.1) Alarms are saved whether they are active or not.
		(2.5.2) Active alarms remain active on next app launch.
	(2.6) Clock position on the screen if not full-screen
(3) On future app-intent launches, the clock loads saved user preferences.


 --- USER INTERFACE ---
(4) A Settings button is positioned in the bottom left corner.
	(4.1) Default icon state uses ic_settings.xml.
	(4.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
(5) A Close button is positioned in the top right corner.
	(5.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
	(5.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.

(6) A clock face appears in the middle of the window
	(6.1) The face can be one of two types:

``ANALOG``
		(6.1.1) A circular analog clock with the following components:
			(6.1.1.1) Numbers 1 - 12 ordered around the interior circumferance of the circle
				(6.1.1.1.1) A second series of numbers, 13 - 24, can be turned on in the settings.
				(6.1.1.1.2) 12-hour clock face: clock_face.xml
				(6.1.1.1.3) 24-hour clock face: clock_face24.xml
					(6.1.1.1.3.1) TODO: Confirm accuracy. Is a 24-hour view programmatically added to clock_face.xml?
			(6.1.1.2) Four small tick marks between each number
			(6.1.1.3) One large tick mark aligned with each number
			(6.1.1.4) A second hand
				(6.1.1.4.1) This can be disabled in the settings.
			(6.1.1.5) A minute hand
			(6.1.1.6) An hour hand.

``DIGITAL``
		(6.1.2) A rectangular digital clock displayed as HH:MM:SS.
			(6.1.2.1) If seconds are turned off in settings, time is displayed HH:MM.
				(6.1.2.1.1) If the clock is set to 12-hour:
					(6.1.2.1.1.1) a leading zero is not included for hours between 1 - 9.
					(6.1.2.1.1.2) AM and PM appear following seconds.
						(6.1.2.1.1.2.1) They are stacked on top of one another, with AM  on top and PM on the bottom.
						(6.1.2.1.1.2.2) When AM is active, PM is not shown.
						(6.1.2.1.1.2.3) When PM is active, AM is not shown.
				(6.1.2.1.2) If the clock is set to 24-hour:
					(6.1.2.1.2.1) Midnight is displayed as 00:00 (not 24:00)
					(6.1.2.1.2.2) a leading zero is included for hours between 0 - 9
	
	(6.2) Time passing is animated:
		(6.2.1) Analog hands rotate around the clock face
		(6.2.2) Digital numbers count upward
			
``NESTED``
(7) A nested clock:
    (7.1) is reduced in size
        (7.1.1) An analog clock is 75px by 75px
        (7.1.2) A digital clock is 75px b7 50px
    (7.2) is affixed to the top right corner of the screen
        (7.2.1) This includes 20px of padding so that the clock does not appear flush against the edge
    (7.3) does not have any (8) control buttons visible.
    (7.4) can still be moved or resized by the user with dragging or pinching actions, like normal.
    (7.5) is stacked if multiple nested clocks are added, with multiple clocks in the top right corner of the screen 
		(7.5.1) Nested clocks are are stacked one above the other, with the newest clock on the bottom.

``BUTTONS``
(8) Below the clock face are two buttons:
	(8.1) Play/Puase
		(8.1.1) Default state: ic_play.xml
		(8.1.2) Active state: ic_pause.xml
	(8.2) Reset

		(8.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
	(8.3) Play/Pause is on the left, and Reset is on the right.
		(8.3.1) This order is reversed for right-to-left languages.


``TIME ZONE DISPLAY``
(9) The time zone selection menu is an interactive 3D globe (scene.gltf)
	(9.1) An overlay divides the globe into time zone sections
	(9.2) Time zones are colored to better show their entire coverage space.
		(9.2.1) The current time zone is not colored
			(9.2.1.1) If not changed by the user, the current time zone matches the system time zone.
			(9.2.1.2) if changed by the user, the system clock settings do not affect the clock app-intent
		(9.2.2) Color overlays have 40% opacity
		(9.2.3) Time zones that are offset by 30 or 45 minutes have a striped coloring that matches the time zone on either side of them.
		(9.2.4) Time zone divisions change based on daylight saving time
			(9.2.4.1) For example, time zones that are UTC-3 may split in half when some of the countries move to daylight saving time and some don't. The color overlay would change at the time shift, with the some of those countries displaying the color for UTC-3 and some displaying UTC-2.
	(9.3) The top of the window includes: 
		(9.3.1) A back arrow in the top left corner of the window. 
			(9.3.1.1) Default icon state uses ic_back.xml.
			(9.3.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
			(9.3.1.3) When activated the time zone display closes.
				(9.3.1.3.1) The user returns to the main settings window.
		(9.3.2) A close button in the top right corner of the window.
			(9.3.2.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
			(9.3.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
			(9.3.2.3) When activated all settings related windows close.
	(9.4) Below the back arrow and close button and above the globe is listed two cities in that time zone.
		(9.4.1) City listings include:
			(9.4.1) City names
			(9.4.2) Country names
			(9.4.3) UTC offset
		(9.4.2) At least one city is in the northern hemisphere whenever possible.
		(9.4.3) At least one city is in the southern hemisphere whenever possible.
		(9.4.4) If only one city is available in that time zone, only one city is displayed.
		(9.4.5) If no cities are available in a time zone, that time zone is not represented on globe.
	(9.5) Each time zone includes two or more city pins 
		(9.5.1) At least one pin is in the northern hemisphere whenever possible.
		(9.5.2) At least one pin is in the southern hemisphere whenever possible.
        (9.5.3) City database entries include latitude and longitude
            (9.5.3.1) These values are not displayed to the user.
            (9.5.3.20 They are tracked to ensure accurate placement of the city pins.
	(9.6) Below the globe are:
		(9.6.1) a right-facing arrow
			(9.6.1.1) Default state: ic_arrow_right.xml
			(9.6.1.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080

			(9.6.3.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080


 --- USER EXPERIENCE ---
(10) ``SETTINGS SUMMARY``
	(10.1) When a user touches the settings button, its icon changes from (4.1) Default to (4.2) Active.

				(10.2.2.1.5) When a mode is activated:
					(10.2.2.1.5.1) The UI changes to that clock types
					(10.2.2.1.5.2) All other user settings are preserved
						(10.2.2.1.5.2.1) For example, a digital 24-hour clock changed to analog would display a 24-hour analog clock face.
			(10.2.2.2) "Colors"
				(10.2.2.2.1) Following the word "Color" is a color square
					(10.2.2.2.1.1) The fill for this square is the color current used for the clock face background

					(10.2.2.4.2.3) The globe can be moved
						(10.2.2.4.2.3.1) by press-hold-dragging a finger
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.1.1) The 3D globe image is spherical. Users may drag their finger in any direction

									(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.3.1.1) For example, the active time zone is UTC+5. Pressing the right arrow changes the active time zone to UTC+5:30.
									(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.3.1.2) For example the active time zone is UTC+5:30. Pressing the right arrow changes the active time zone to UTC+5:45.
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.2.4) If there are multiple time zones with the same UTC offset, use the order set in the (10.2.2.4.2.4) database to define which time zone becomes active when pressing the left or right arrow buttons.
						(10.2.2.4.2.3.3) by pressing the circle between the left and right arrows
							(10.2.2.4.2.3.3.1) Pressing this button centers the globe on the current time zone.
					(10.2.2.4.2.4) UTC offset, city, and country information are included in a database.
                        (10.2.2.4.2.4.1) See ThePurramid01\app\src\main\assets\cities_timezones.csv

							(10.2.2.8.1.2.2.10) For example, a new clock opened from a 300px by 300px analog clock that has a light blue clock face would also be a 300px by 300px analog clock with a light blue clock face.
					(10.2.2.8.1.3) If four clocks already exist on the screen, the add Another setting is inactivated.
