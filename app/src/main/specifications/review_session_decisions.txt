- **Architecture**: Add a sequence selection marquee to traffic light UI
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Do not use edit sequence for sequence selection
    - Remove selection functionality from settings
  - Add a marquee (a rectangle with rounded corners, as used in Randomizers) to the bottom of the traffic light
    - The marquee is only present when in Timed Change mode
	- The marquee shows the title of the active sequence
	- If the teacher has not manually selected a sequence, the active sequence is the last one edited
	- The marquee includes a drop down triangle that opens a drop down list
  - The drop down list shows all available sequences
    - The active sequence is the top option
	- All other options are listed in alphanumeric order

- **Architecture**: Window Management for Activities
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Randomziers and Probabilities use ui.WindowState.kt to manage windows
    - Services continue to use WindowManager.LayoutParams
TODO: Determine if this is the best approach
  
- **Reviewed**: 5 July 2025
- **Architecture**: Randomizer Spin Animation Duration
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Randomziers spin animation has a cap of 3 seconds for lists that have 30 items or more.
    - Previously it was 1 second for every ten items, rounded up, which meant max time could be five seconds.
