Timers are companion countdown timer and stopwatch. These appear only as digital clocks.

 --- RUNTIME EVENTS ---
(1) On first app-intent launch, the timer opens in a windowed state.
(2) The most recent timer user preferences are saved. Save the following:
	(2.1) Timer size
	(2.2) Background color
	(2.3) Set countdown time
	(2.4) Hundredths togle state
	(2.5) Ending alarm toggle state
	(2.6) User-defined music URL
    (2.7) Sequence toggle state
    (2.8) Lap toggle state
    (2.9) Sounds toggle state
(3) On future app-intent launches, the timer loads saved user preferences.


 --- USER INTERFACE ---
(4) A Settings button is positioned in the bottom left corner.
	(4.1) Default icon state uses ic_settings.xml.
	(4.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
(5) A Close button is positioned in the top right corner.
	(5.1) Default icon state uses ic_close.xml.
	(5.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080.
(6) All timers use a digital clock face HH:MM:SS
    (6.1) Hundredths will be abbreviated as cs (centiseconds) in the instructions, but all user-facing strings say Hundredths.
    (6.2) If Hundredths is toggled on, time displays as HH:MM:SS.cs
        (6.2.1) Hundredths appear 0.6f the size of the other numbers.
        (6.2.2) Hundredths are separated from seconds with a period not a colon.

``BUTTONS``
(7) Below the timer clock is two buttons:
	(7.1) Play/Puase
		(7.1.1) Default state: ic_play.xml
		(7.1.2) Active state: ic_pause.xml
	(7.2) Reset
		(7.2.1) Default state: ic_reset.xml
		(7.2.2) Active state: Programmatically change fill colors for default state icons to #808080
	(7.3) Play/Pause is on the left, and Reset is on the right.
		(7.3.1) This order is reversed for right-to-left languages.

``NESTED``
(8) A nested timer:
    (8.1) is reduced in size, 75px by 75px
    (8.2) is affixed to the top right corner of the screen
        (8.2.1) This includes 20px of padding so that the timer does not appear flush against the edge
    (8.3) does not have any (7) control buttons visible.
    (8.4) can still be moved or resized by the user with dragging or pinching actions, like normal.
    (8.5) is stacked if multiple nested timers are added, with multiple timers in the top right corner of the screen 
		(8.5.1) Nested timers are are stacked one above the other, with the newest timer on the bottom.


 --- USER EXPERIENCE ---
(9) ``SETTINGS SUMMARY``
	(9.1) When a user touches the settings button, its icon changes from (4.1) Default to (4.2) Active.
	(9.2) When activated, a settings menu extends with a smooth transition animation from the settings button.
		(9.2.1) The settings button remains active while the settings window is open.
		(9.2.2) The settings window is rows of strings and an icon:
			(9.2.2.1) "Mode"
				(9.2.2.1.2) Following the word "Mode" are two icons:
					(9.2.2.1.2.1) A countdown icon
					(9.2.2.1.2.2) A stopwatch icon
				(9.2.2.1.3) The active mode has:
					(9.2.2.1.3.1) its fill programmatically changed to #808080
					(9.2.2.1.3.2) A thick blue bar beneath the icon
				(9.2.2.1.4) The default mode is (9.2.2.1.2.2) Countdown Timer
				(9.2.2.1.5) When a mode is activated, the UI changes to that timer type
			(9.2.2.2) "Colors"
				(9.2.2.2.1) Following the word "Color" is a color square
					(9.2.2.2.1.1) The fill for this square is the color current used for the clock face background
					(9.2.2.2.1.2) The default color is White.
				(9.2.2.2.2) If the user taps the word "Color" or the color square, a color picker opens.
				(9.2.2.2.3) The color picker displays the six color options from PurramidPalette.kt
					(9.2.2.2.3.1) This color applies to the clock face background
					(9.2.2.2.3.2) Clock hands and numbers are either black and white depending on which option creates the best color contrast with the background color.










(12) TODO: Is "Enable Overlay" implemented correctly? It should be an auto-prompt and not a button.
