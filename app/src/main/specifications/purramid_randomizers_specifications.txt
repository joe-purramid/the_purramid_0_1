						(7.1.2.5.2.1) The "ones" die uses numbers from 0 - 9
						(7.1.2.5.2.2) The "tens" die adds a 0 following the 0 - 9 numbers (00 - 90)
							(7.1.2.5.2.2.1) For example, a 1 on a "ones" d10 is 10 on a "tens" d10.
						(7.1.2.5.2.3) A percentile role displays as a sum of the two dice.
							(7.1.2.5.2.3.1) For example, a roll of a 10 and a 1 is a roll of an 11.

			(7.2.2.4) Five die types would loosely form a pentagon
			(7.2.2.5) Six die types woudl loosely form a hexagon.
			(7.2.2.6) These shapes do not need to be exact, but offer a simple model for how to ensure space is availabe between each group of dice.
	(7.3) Below the display area are three buttons
		(7.3.1) Roll

Sum Results - This setting is available only if Announcement is toggled on. It is a drop-down menu that allows the user to choose between "Individual" (the default), "Sum Die Type", and "Sum Total". Individual announces the results of each die rolled as a series or array. Sum Die Type announces the summed results for each die type that has one or more dice of its type in the die pool (2d4 with the result of 1 and 3 would display as 4; 0d8 would not display a result). Sum Total announces the summed results of all dice rolled as a single number.

				
		
``ADD MODIFIERS``
		(14.5.8) "Add Modifiers"


Add Modifiers - This setting is available only if Announcement is toggled on. This functions similar to color, but instead of a color square, there is a text field to the right of the polyhedral. By default, all modifiers are set to 0. When tapping the text field, the system number pad opens and the user can enter a number between 0 and 100. When announcing a result, this number is added to the sum of its assigned die type. For example, if d4 had a modifier of 2, 2d4 with results of 1 and 3 would announce: 3 and 5 (for individual) or 8 (for sum die type/sum total).



``CRITICIAL CELEBRATION``

``COIN FLIP MODE SETTINGS``



DICE MODE 











Graph Distribution - This opens a window with radio buttons "Off" (default), "Manual", "Normal", "Uniform". Below the radio buttons are three line-style icon buttons "solid line" (default), "dashed line", and "dotted line". The graph line displayed after a roll result is the type selected here (solid line, dashed line, or dotted line).



If "Normal" or "Uniform" are selected, there is also a number field and the string "number of rolls" below the line-style buttons. This value is set at 1000 by default. How large of a number of roll computations can we achieve in three seconds?



If Manual, Normal, or Uniform radio buttons are selected, Announcement is automatically toggled off. If announcement is toggled on, Graph Distribution changes to off.



When Graph Distribution is active and the roll button is pressed, the following behaviors occur:



Manual: The roll animation (if active) lasts 0.5 seconds. The result becomes the first entry on an x-y line graph, where the x axis is the number rolls in 5-roll increments (rounded up). The y axis is increments of one to the maximum total possible result (based on sum results setting selection). The roll animation does not need to complete for the user to be able to press the roll button again. With rapid tapping, the animation continues through 0.5 seconds after the final tap (total roll time is not summed based on number of taps). Each tap yields a new result on the line graph. The x-axis grows as the number of rolls exceeds increments of five. A "reset" button should appear beside the Dice Pool button. If pressed, the manual graph is eliminated. Pressing the roll button would then begin a new graph. (Consider whether a reset button should be included for Normal and Uniform as well.)



If Sum Results is set to "individual", each die within a die type is considered a separate roll. 5d10 would yield 5 dots along the x-axis even if the roll button was only pressed once. If the dice pool contains more than one die type, each die type gets its own line on the graph. Lines should be different colors (using the color sequence we created for spin dial wedges to ensure proper contrast).



If Sum Results is set to "Sum Die Type", the functionality is the same as "individual" except multiple dice of the same die type are summed together and entered as a single point on the x-axis. This means the number of points on the x-axis would equal the number of times the roll button is pressed. 



If Sum results is set to "Sum Total", the functionality is the same as "Sum Results" except there is only a single line on the graph rather than a line for each die type. The Y-axis uses increments of 10% of the total possible value (rounded to the closest whole number) after the total sum surpasses the number 20.



Normal: This functionality matches "Manual" with the following variations. The roll animation (if active) lasts for 3.0 seconds. During that time, a number of roles equal to the number listed in settings (default 1000) are computed and a graph with a Normal distribution is plotted. The behaviors for Sum Results settings are the same as in Manual. If the user presses the roll button, the current graph is removed, and a new graph is created.



Uniform: This functionality matches "Manual" with the following variations. The roll animation (if active) lasts for 3.0 seconds. During that time, a number of roles equal to the number listed in settings (default 1000) are computed and a graph with a Uniform distribution is plotted. The behaviors for Sum Results settings are the same as in Manual. If the user presses the roll button, the current graph is removed, and a new graph is created.



The last setting is "Add Another Dice Pool". A total of seven pools can be created. Each window should have a close button and a settings button.


''COIN FLIP''

Each window includes its own pool of coins. Coins available are 1 bit (1b), 5 bits (5b), 10 bits (10b), 25 bits (25b), 1 meatball (1MB), and 2 meatballs (2MB). A user can have a max of ten of each coin in their pool. Coin flipping behavior will be the same as dice rolling, with a button that flips all the coins in the user's pool. Coins animate a flipping motion for 0.75 seconds and then display either a heads (obverse) or tails (reverse) result.



The settings for coin flip are as follows:



1. Mode - Spin, Slots, Dice, Coin Flip



2. Coin Colors - this uses the colorpalette shared file. Goldenrod is the default color.



3. Flip Animation - on/off toggle, default on. If turned off, the coin flip animation is not shown and the result is displayed immediately.



4. Free Form - on/off toggle, default off. When on, all dice in the dice pool appear on the screen. They show their heads (obverse) side. The Flip button is replaced with a Tails button. If pressed, all coins switch to their tails (reverse) side and the button changes to a Heads button. The user can drag each coin anywhere within the bounds of the window.



5. Announcement - On/off toggle, default on. Match the Dice Announcement design. Mutually exclusive with Probability and free form.



6. Probability - Drop down, default "None". The drop-down menu includes the following options:

- None: Default behavior



- Two Columns: Two adjacent columns, heads and tails, appeaer in the window. When coins are flipped



- 3x3 Grid: A 3x3 matrix of empty boxes appears in the window. Each time the user flips a coin/coins, the result of H or T appears in a box, starting at the top left and filling horizontally. When one row is filled, results start on the next row until all boxes are full.



If multiple coins are in the pool, the numbers of the total of each obverse and reverse are listed *H/*T. The type of coin is not tracked. For example, if the user has four 1MB and two 25b and the flip resulted in 1MB - H, H, H, T and 25b - T, T, the box would show 3H/3T.



If all boxes are full, the Flip button turns into a Reset button.



If a user taps a box, a flip action is implemented for that box and any other empty boxes that come before it. For example, the first two boxes of the top row of a 3x3 grid are filled. The user taps the middle box of the second row. Three flip actions will occur, with results populating the top right, middle left, and middle center boxes, in that order. If a user taps a box that is already filled, nothing happens.



- 6x6 Grid: The same as 3x3 but with a larger matrix.



- 10x10 Grid: The same as 3x3 but with a larger matrix.



- Graph Distribution



If graph disstribution is selected, the following settings become visible:

- Graph Distribution Type - match Dice graph distribution design

- Graph Line Style - match Dice line style design

- Graph Flip Count - match Dice flip count design
